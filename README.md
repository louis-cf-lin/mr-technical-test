# MR Frontend Developer Technical Test

This is a project made in fulfillment of the MR Frontend Developer Technical Test.

🚀 Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

💻 Deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - visit it at <https://mr-technical-test.vercel.app/>.

## CSS

The prototypes were reproduced in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/duyxFFgA3awlQvnTitU11P/MR-Technical-Interview?node-id=0%3A1) to determine units and measurements. Some CSS values are arbitrary for replication purposes.

Fonts used are Inter and DM Sans.

CSS is written in Sassy CSS syntax and pre-compiled with Sass.

## Responsive Design

Following [typical media queries](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_media_query_breakpoints.asp), the page has two breakpoints:

- 768px
- 1200px

Measurements between the two prototypes provided are interpolated. For example, `font-size: 12px` on mobile and `font-size: 16px` on desktop means `font-size: 14px` on tablet.

## Other Notes

## Automated Testing

This project does not utilise automated testing due to my limited experience with testing frameworks such as Jest and Cypress. However, I have plans to learn them this year.
